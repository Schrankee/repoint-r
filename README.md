# repoint-r
Documentum Repoint "resurrected".

NEWS

*"Add External Docbroker" in the login window. In this way it is now possible to add a docbase from a different docbroker than defined in dfc.properties. It is also possible to add docbases even without dfc.properties. All without quitting and starting up repoint again.

Older NEWS:

* Project finally compiles and should work exactly the same as the last repoint version available from the original Author.
* File selector was added to the Checkin window that allows selecting a file to check in.
* Simple ACL viewer was added to the Docbrowser and to the DQL results view.

Goal of this project is to:

* make the build process as simple as possible - convert native Eclipse RCP project to Eclipse Tycho (done)
* update repoint so it works with Java 1.7+ (done)
* add support for editing ACLs
* add Trusted Content Services support
* add support for creating sessions without need of modifying dfc.properties
* if possible update RCP code and remove deprecated fragments (in progress...)
* ...

* fix bugs
